# Audits & Reports
- When asked to analyze the repo, always:
  - Cite exact file paths and line ranges for every claim.
  - Include short code quotes for each finding.
  - Provide a risk matrix (Likelihood x Impact) with priority labels (P0/P1/P2).
  - Propose concrete fixes as diffs or step-by-step patches.
  - If uncertain, explicitly say "Uncertain" and list what to inspect next.
- Do not invent files or dependencies. If not found, say so.
- Prefer conservative changes over risky rewrites.
